  paragraphOne: `About me (ü§ì  edition) :
  I enjoy creating and building applications as well as learning about technology. 
  My geeky interest includes but is not exhausted to machine learning, software 
  development, system design, data structures and algorithms and just a little bit of math 
  ...keyword a bit! `,
  paragraphTwo: `About me (üòé edition): 
  Apart from nerdy pursuits, I have many other interest too! One thing I really 
  enjoy is teaching. The satisfaction you gain when you helped someone understand a 
  difficult concept is second to none. Apart from that, I am also a fitness enthusiast 
  (I LOVE BASKETBALL) as well as a tech junkie. (Apple fanboy). Oh and one thing, I can't sing but 
  I love singing. (all my friends know this REALLY WELL)`,
  paragraphThree: `From my projects below, you can check out my personal projects as well as ventures! 
  You may notice that most of my projects are in line with my interest and pursuits. One thing I love 
  about software engineering is it's flexibility and ability to add value in any relevant fields. Because of this,
  I am genuinely happy and thankful to be in this field where they call "Computer Science".  `,

    quality as well as software engineering principles where we focused less on quantity of features but instead
    bug free and error handled features. Also, we handled most of our changes through github by requesting pull 
    request as well as reviewed each other's code. We adopted the "forking workflow" which improved the
    stability of our application due to the stringent version control process. Project was completed with user and
    developer guides which are linked below as well as an "About us" team page.`,
